L2 Cache Clock Controller

The L2 Cache Clock Controller provides clock, power domain, and
reset control to a L2-cache for a cluster. There is L2CCC register
region per CPU Cluster.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Can be one of:
		"qcom,8994-l2ccc"
		"qcom,8916-l2ccc"

- reg:		This specifies the base address and size of
		the register region.
		The second tuple specifies the address of the voltage control
		register. This register is only required if the qcom,vctl-val
		is specified.

Optional properties:
 - qcom,vctl-val: The voltage control register value that must be set before
		the caches can be turned on. This would be a required property
		if the target necessitates a voltage rail be turned on before
		turning on the cache.

Example:

	clock-controller@f900f000 {
		compatible = "qcom,8994-l2ccc"";
		reg = <0xf900f000 0x1000>,
		      <0xf901301c 4>;
		qcom,vctl-val = <0xb8>;
	}
